# Keybindings Reference

All keybindings use the `Alt` (Option) key as the primary modifier. Add `Shift` for move operations.

## Quick Reference

### Focus Navigation

Move focus between windows using vim-style navigation:

| Keybinding | Action | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `Alt+H` | Focus left | Move focus to the window on the left |
| `Alt+J` | Focus down | Move focus to the window below |
| `Alt+K` | Focus up | Move focus to the window above |
| `Alt+L` | Focus right | Move focus to the window on the right |

### Window Movement

Move windows between positions:

| Keybinding | Action | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `Alt+Shift+H` | Move left | Move current window to the left |
| `Alt+Shift+J` | Move down | Move current window down |
| `Alt+Shift+K` | Move up | Move current window up |
| `Alt+Shift+L` | Move right | Move current window to the right |

### Window Resizing

| Keybinding | Action | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `Alt+Shift+-` | Shrink | Decrease window size by 50 pixels |
| `Alt+Shift+=` | Grow | Increase window size by 50 pixels |

<Note>
Resizing uses "smart" mode, which automatically determines whether to resize horizontally or vertically based on the current layout orientation.
</Note>

### Layout Management

| Keybinding | Action | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `Alt+/` | Toggle tiles layout | Cycle through horizontal and vertical tiles layouts |
| `Alt+,` | Toggle accordion layout | Cycle through horizontal and vertical accordion layouts |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tiles Layout">
    The default layout where windows are arranged in a tree structure. Windows can be split horizontally or vertically, creating a flexible tiling system.
    
    - **Horizontal**: Windows are arranged side-by-side
    - **Vertical**: Windows are stacked top-to-bottom
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accordion Layout">
    A layout style where one window is focused and others are minimized with padding (30 pixels by default). Useful for focusing on a single window while keeping others visible.
    
    - **Horizontal**: Accordion effect arranged horizontally
    - **Vertical**: Accordion effect arranged vertically
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

<Tip>
Use `Alt+Tab` to quickly switch between your two most recent workspaces, similar to Alt+Tab window switching in traditional desktop environments.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If your layout gets messy, press `Alt+Shift+;` then `r` to reset the workspace tree and start fresh.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The smart resize (`Alt+Shift+-` and `Alt+Shift+=`) automatically determines the best direction to resize based on your current layout orientation.
