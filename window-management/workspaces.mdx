# Workspaces

Workspaces in AeroSpace provide virtual desktops for organizing your windows. You have access to 35 workspaces: 9 numbered (1-9) and 26 lettered (A-Z).

## Workspace Overview

### Available Workspaces

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Numbered Workspaces" icon="hashtag">
    **Workspaces 1-9**
    
    Quick access using `Alt+[1-9]`
    
    Ideal for frequently used applications
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Lettered Workspaces" icon="font">
    **Workspaces A-Z** (excluding H, J, K, L)
    
    31 additional workspaces for specialized tasks
    
    Press `Alt+[letter]` to switch
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Workspaces H, J, K, and L are not available because those keys are reserved for focus navigation (left, down, up, right).
</Note>

## Switching Workspaces

### Number Workspaces (1-9)

The numbered workspaces are easily accessible and perfect for your most-used applications:

```
Alt+1 → Workspace 1
Alt+2 → Workspace 2
Alt+3 → Workspace 3
...
Alt+9 → Workspace 9
```

### Letter Workspaces (A-Z)

Letter workspaces provide additional organization:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Available Letters">
    ```
    Alt+A → Workspace A    Alt+N → Workspace N
    Alt+B → Workspace B    Alt+O → Workspace O
    Alt+C → Workspace C    Alt+P → Workspace P
    Alt+D → Workspace D    Alt+Q → Workspace Q
    Alt+E → Workspace E    Alt+R → Workspace R
    Alt+F → Workspace F    Alt+S → Workspace S
    Alt+G → Workspace G    Alt+T → Workspace T
    Alt+I → Workspace I    Alt+U → Workspace U
    Alt+M → Workspace M    Alt+V → Workspace V
                           Alt+W → Workspace W
                           Alt+X → Workspace X
                           Alt+Y → Workspace Y
                           Alt+Z → Workspace Z
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reserved Letters">
    The following letters are **not available** as workspaces:
    
    - **H**: Focus left (`Alt+H`)
    - **J**: Focus down (`Alt+J`)
    - **K**: Focus up (`Alt+K`)
    - **L**: Focus right (`Alt+L`)
    
    These keys are used for vim-style window navigation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Moving Windows Between Workspaces

### Basic Window Movement

Move the currently focused window to any workspace by adding `Shift` to the workspace keybinding:

```
Alt+Shift+1 → Move window to workspace 1
Alt+Shift+2 → Move window to workspace 2
Alt+Shift+A → Move window to workspace A
Alt+Shift+B → Move window to workspace B
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Focus the window">
    Use `Alt+H/J/K/L` to focus the window you want to move.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move to workspace">
    Press `Alt+Shift+[workspace]` where `[workspace]` is the target workspace number or letter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow (optional)">
    If you want to follow the window to the new workspace, press `Alt+[workspace]` immediately after.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Quick Workspace Switching

| Command | Action | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `Alt+Tab` | Switch to previous workspace | Quickly toggle between two workspaces |
| `Alt+[workspace]` | Switch to specific workspace | Jump directly to a workspace |
| `Alt+Shift+Tab` | Move workspace to next monitor | Useful in multi-monitor setups |

## Workspace Organization Strategies

### By Application Type

Organize workspaces based on application categories:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Development Setup">
    - **Workspace 1**: Code editor (VS Code, Neovim)
    - **Workspace 2**: Terminal windows
    - **Workspace 3**: Browser with documentation
    - **Workspace 4**: Database tools / API clients
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communication Setup">
    - **Workspace C**: Chat applications (Slack, Discord)
    - **Workspace E**: Email client
    - **Workspace M**: Calendar and meetings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Creation">
    - **Workspace D**: Design tools (Figma, Sketch)
    - **Workspace V**: Video editing
    - **Workspace P**: Photo editing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Research & Writing">
    - **Workspace B**: Browser for research
    - **Workspace W**: Writing application (Notion, Obsidian)
    - **Workspace N**: Notes and references
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### By Project

Dedicate workspace ranges to different projects:

```
Project A:
  - Workspace 1-3: Code, terminal, browser
  - Workspace A: Additional tools

Project B:
  - Workspace 4-6: Code, terminal, browser
  - Workspace B: Additional tools

Personal:
  - Workspace 7-9: Personal applications
```

### By Context

Organize based on work context:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Focus Work" icon="bullseye">
    **Workspaces 1-3**
    
    Deep work applications with minimal distractions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Communication" icon="comments">
    **Workspaces 4-5**
    
    Email, chat, video calls
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Reference" icon="book">
    **Workspaces 6-7**
    
    Documentation, research, notes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Utilities" icon="wrench">
    **Workspaces 8-9**
    
    System monitors, file managers, utilities
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Multi-Monitor Workspaces

### Workspace-Monitor Assignment

Workspaces can be moved between monitors:

```bash
# Move current workspace to next monitor
Alt+Shift+Tab
```

This command wraps around, so if you're on the last monitor, it moves to the first.

### Multi-Monitor Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign primary workspaces">
    Keep frequently used workspaces (1-3) on your primary monitor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use secondary for context">
    Move reference workspaces (documentation, communication) to secondary monitor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quick workspace moves">
    Use `Alt+Shift+Tab` to quickly reorganize workspace layout across monitors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workspace Management

### Viewing Workspace State

AeroSpace doesn't have a built-in workspace indicator, but you can:

1. Use the macOS menu bar to see the current workspace
2. Integrate with status bars like [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)
3. Simply remember based on application context

### Cleaning Up Workspaces

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Close All But Current Window">
    **In service mode:**
    
    1. Press `Alt+Shift+;` to enter service mode
    2. Press `Backspace` to close all windows except current
    3. Returns to main mode automatically
    
    Useful for quickly cleaning up a cluttered workspace.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reset Workspace Layout">
    **In service mode:**
    
    1. Press `Alt+Shift+;` to enter service mode
    2. Press `r` to flatten the workspace tree
    3. Returns to main mode automatically
    
    Resets the layout structure without closing windows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Move Windows Out">
    Manually move windows to other workspaces:
    
    1. Focus window with `Alt+H/J/K/L`
    2. Press `Alt+Shift+[workspace]` to move it
    3. Repeat for each window
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips & Best Practices

<Tip>
**Keep it simple**: Start with just 3-5 workspaces and expand as needed. Too many workspaces can be as confusing as too few.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use memorable mappings**: Map workspaces to application initials (e.g., workspace C for Chat, workspace M for Mail).
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Leverage Alt+Tab**: The back-and-forth command is one of the most powerful features. Use it to quickly toggle between two contexts.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Empty workspaces are fine**: Don't feel obligated to use all 35 workspaces. Empty workspaces consume no resources.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Workspaces are created on-demand. If you switch to a workspace with no windows, you'll see an empty desktop. Press your application launcher keybinding or switch to another workspace.
</Warning>
