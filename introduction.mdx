## Welcome to YangleyLand Configs

A carefully crafted collection of configuration files for building a powerful, efficient development environment on macOS. This setup brings together the best modern terminal tools with a unified Vim-style navigation experience.

<Note>
  All configurations are built around **Vim-style keybindings** (hjkl navigation) for consistent muscle memory across your entire workflow.

## Quick Preview

### Neovim Configuration Highlights

```lua nvim/lua/config/options.lua
-- Set root directory to current working directory
vim.g.root_spec = { "cwd" }
```

### Tmux with Vim Keybindings

```bash tmux/tmux.conf
# Vim-style navigation in copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-selection

# Custom prefix: Ctrl-Space
set -g prefix C-Space
```

### AeroSpace Window Management

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
# Vim-style focus navigation
alt-h = 'focus left'
alt-j = 'focus down'
alt-k = 'focus up'
alt-l = 'focus right'

# Move windows with Shift
alt-shift-h = 'move left'
alt-shift-j = 'move down'
alt-shift-k = 'move up'
alt-shift-l = 'move right'
```

## Philosophy

This configuration is built on three principles:

1. **Consistency**: Vim keybindings everywhere possible
2. **Speed**: Fast tools with optimized configurations
3. **Simplicity**: Minimal setup, maximum productivity

<Warning>
  This configuration is optimized for **macOS**. While Neovim, Tmux, and Alacritty work cross-platform, AeroSpace is macOS-specific.
</Warning>
